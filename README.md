# FuncsArranger

## Executive summary
This tool aims to increase the speed of programs execution by suggesting a new order of functions for the executable. This way, processing time is saved on branching and boosts the whole process.

## Technical details
In order to conclude the best ordering of the functions in the binary, first the executable is ran, profiled, various data collected regarding each function, and then a genetic algorithm determines the best ordering based on the gathered information.

### Profiling
The profiling is done using the *gprof* Linux utility and than analyzed using python. 

### Ordering algorithm
Our case is similar to the Minimum Linear Arrangement of a Directed Graph (MINLARD) problem. This problem is proven to be NP-hard in [S. Even and Y. Shiloah, *NP-completeness of several arrangement problems*, Technical Report no. 43 of the Department of Computer Science, Israel Institute of Technology (Technion), 1975](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/users/wwwb/cgi-bin/tr-get.cgi/1975/CS/CS0043.pdf) (on page 11 at the bottom, Theorem 5). Thus, our approach is rather a heuristic than an algorithm. The solution of our choice involves a rather simple and straight forward [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm). The algorithm follows the following rules,
* The **population** consists of genes, where each one of them is a linear arrangement of the functions. 
* The **fitness function** is calculated as follows, for each two functions in a gene, denoted by *A* and *B*, the fitness is given by the product of the distance between *A* and *B* in the binary, and the number of times *A* calls *B* and *B* calls *A*. The fitness between each two functions is then summed up.
* A **mutation** is an exchange of two functions in random indices in the linear ordering. 

### Requirements
 * Python 3 (tested on 3.5)
  - External libraries: [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
 * The [nm](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nm) Linux tool
 * The [gprof](https://linux.die.net/man/1/gprof) Linux tool

## Usage
In order to run the compilation and profiling, type in,
```
make ARGS="<the name of your file goes here>"
```

## Files in project
* main.py - as the name implies, this is the entry point of the whole program. It is responsible for calling the right functions in the right order and to print out the output.
* GenFuncLength.py - deduces the length of the functions by parsing the output from the *nm* tool.
* ParseCallGraph.py - parses the call graph generated by the *gprof* tool.
* gen_alg.py - finds the best linear arrangement of the functions in the binary by applying the [genetic algorithm](#ordering-algorithm) 
* test.c - a test file.
* utils.c - some utils funcstions.
